# less-js-wampile
This is a LESS compiler with JS and Functions compilation set up by default. This is super easy to use, just provide the input and output path as parameters respectively and it will compile all the LESS files into CSS the the same folder where the original files are. This also watches the files and recompiles upon changes.
